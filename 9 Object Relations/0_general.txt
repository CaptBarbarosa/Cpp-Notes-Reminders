Const objects are not mutable.
We can call only const member functions of a const object.

friend keyword is used when an external function or class needs to access private 
members, friend declaration is used to grant access.

        Relations
--> Aggragate ("has a"): If class A and B are aggregates, class A can have 0 or more instance of clss B. 
Lifetime of B are INDEPENDENT of class A.
--> Composition ("has a"): Class A has 0 or more instance of class B.
And the lifetime of class B objects depend on the class A object.
--> Generalization (inheritance "is a")


Members of the subclass hides member of the superclass with the same name.
